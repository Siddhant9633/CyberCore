1. **Disconnect from the Network:** Turn off Wi-Fi or unplug Ethernet immediately if you suspect a file was downloaded.
2. **Do NOT Enter Any Credentials:** If the page asked for login, password, or OTP, never submit it.
3. **Change Compromised Passwords:** If you submitted your password, immediately change it from a different, trusted device. Enable 2-Factor Authentication (2FA).
4. **Scan Your Device:** Run a comprehensive scan with reputable antivirus or Windows Defender.
5. **Check Recent Downloads:** Inspect your Downloads folder for recently saved `.exe`, `.scr`, `.bat`, or `.iso` files and delete them without opening.
6. **Monitor Financial Accounts:** If banking details or cards were involved, notify your bank immediately to freeze the card or account."""

**Legitimate banks, payment gateways, and organizations NEVER call or message you asking for your OTP.**

- Scammers frequently pose as bank representatives claiming your "KYC is expiring", "card is blocked", or "unauthorized transaction needs cancellation".
- Sharing the OTP gives attackers full access to transfer funds or authenticate logins.
- If anyone asks for your OTP, immediately hang up, block their number, and contact your bank using the official phone number on the back of your card."""

1. **Length Beats Complexity:** A 16+ character passphrase like `solar-granite-blue-meadow` is astronomically harder to crack than `P@ss123`.
2. **Never Reuse Passwords:** If one site gets breached, attackers use credential stuffing across all other services (email, banking, social media).
3. **Use a Password Manager:** Bitwarden, 1Password, or Apple Keychain generate and store unique, strong credentials for every site.
4. **Always Enable 2FA:** Prefer Authenticator Apps (Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator) or hardware security keys over SMS verification."""

Attackers register domains that look almost identical to trusted brands to trick users:

- **Omission/Addition:** `amazn.com` or `netflix-verify.com`.
- **Combosquatting:** Adding terms like `login-`, `secure-`, or `-support` (e.g. `chase-security-login.com`).
- **Homograph attacks:** Using lookalike characters from other alphabets (Cyrillic `а` instead of Latin `a`).

CYBERCORE inspects domain registration age, DNS entries, and character entropy to detect these attacks before you enter data."""

Public networks in hotels, cafes, and airports carry risks of **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)** attacks and **Evil Twin** fake hotspots:
1. **Verify HTTPS:** Ensure websites display the padlock and valid SSL certificate.
2. **Use a Reputable VPN:** Encrypts all traffic between your device and the internet, preventing anyone on the local Wi-Fi from inspecting your packet stream.
3. **Turn Off File Sharing:** Disable AirDrop / file sharing and set your network profile to 'Public'.
4. **Avoid Sensitive Transactions:** Save banking and sensitive account logins for cellular data (4G/5G) or a trusted private network."""

Thank you for consulting CYBERCORE AI regarding your digital security query.

Key Protective Guidelines:
1. **Verify Before Trusting:** Never trust unsolicited messages, unexpected attachments, or urgent demands for verification.
2. **Inspect URLs Carefully:** Look at the exact domain name before entering credentials. Pay attention to subdomains and unusual top-level domains (.xyz, .top, .ru).
3. **Protect Authentication Secrets:** Never disclose OTPs, PINs, or passwords to anyone, even if they claim to represent technical support or law enforcement.
4. **Use CYBERCORE Tools:** You can run any suspicious link through the **CYBERCORE Website Scanner**, analyze suspicious messages with the **Message Scanner**, or verify suspicious files in the **File Security** module.
